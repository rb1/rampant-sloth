# rampant-sloth

I'm not sure if GitHub suggested the name or if I was inspired by GitHub's suggestions.

This is a sort of dumping ground for various Space Engineers Programmable Block scripts. Most of them are very specific to very specific builds i was playing with while learning to script. Some of them are a poor replacement for established scripts that already exist (i.e. RenameBlocks).

I use the most excellent MDK2 frameworkk to build and install them and (at the time of writing) haven't pubished any of them to Steam Workshop.
